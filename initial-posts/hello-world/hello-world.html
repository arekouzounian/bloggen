<hr>

<p>This is my very first blog post, and it&rsquo;s being written in markdown. I thought I&rsquo;d take this opportunity to explain my idea for this project, while the project is being built! In fact, at this point in time, the only thing I&rsquo;ve implemented so far is the ability to convert markdown files to HTML using the CLI tool. Let&rsquo;s take a look at what I&rsquo;m trying to build!</p>

<h2 id="website-history">Website History</h2>

<p>It started with my first website; an idea to make a personal website, combined with my growing fondness for the computer terminal. I decided to make a <a href="https://arekouzounian.com" target="_blank">personal website that felt like a bash-like terminal</a>, and over the course of a few weeks, I succeeded! However, I soon realized that employers and non-tech savvy people would be entirely confused by my original website design. Rather than throw it all away, I opted to create a <a href="https://gui.arekouzounian.com" target="_blank">second website, one that was much more visual and graphical</a>. Further, I decided to create a third website, this time employing a REST-style API that the two other websites could draw from to sync their content. Some Flask, Apache, and JavaScript later, it worked! All three websites were up and running.</p>

<h2 id="the-idea">The Idea</h2>

<p>Through my work as a Teaching Assistant and Course Producer, as well as all the learning about technology I do in my free time, I realized that having a blog to catalogue thoughts and talk about personal projects/ideas would be a great idea. As I thought about the process of integrating a blog into my personal website, I realized that the typical process would be tedious; whether it was integrating some pre-made blogging framework into my existing backend, or manually creating blog posts in HTML every time I wanted to blog about something, then manually putting those files on my servers&ndash;none of those options seemed appealing to me. So, I set out to create my own blogging framework, one that could abstract all of the tediousness behind a simple client and server model that was highly flexible and easy to use. Here we are!</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>That brings us to the end of this blog post. I have some notes after this that are mainly for myself; just a couple questions and ideas I thought of while writing this blog post.</p>

<p>How to ensure embedded media works correctly?</p>

<ul>
<li>parse the markdown file to look for relative links to media, then fetch and send to server?</li>
<li>have a CLI tool command like &lsquo;bloggen post init&rsquo; that creates a directory structure that contains areas for the post, and an asset subdirectory

<ul>
<li>for uploading, tool tar&rsquo;s the folders together then sends all in one file?</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
