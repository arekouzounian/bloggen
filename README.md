# bloggen 
--- 
A simplified blogging framework for personal use. 

The rough ideas for the project can be found in [the idea doc](./idea-doc.md), where I initially put my ideas for the project. 

This framework is intended to allow one to set-up and add to a simple web-based blog quickly. The idea is to write blog posts in markdown, and have a set of tools and software communicating with each other to allow quick, painless blog post uploading to a central server. 

The goal was for these tools to be developed for my own personal blog, but a secondary goal is to allow this set of tools to be configurable in such a way that anyone could use this to deploy their own personal blog. 

The web-based frontend will be housed in the [frontend folder](./frontend/), the command-line interface code will be in [the cli folder](./cli/), and  server-side code doesn't exist quite yet, but will likely be stashed away under some future folder. 

This project is in active development; it is not yet ready to be downloaded and used.
