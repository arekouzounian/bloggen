<h1 id="back-to-working">Back to Working</h1>

<hr>

<p>For anyone reading this, no time has passed at all (since the blog is still not up), but for me, several weeks have passed since I was working on this project. I lost a good bit of motivation, and have been enjoying my summer with a bunch of different activities and friends.</p>

<p>Regardless, it&rsquo;s time I got back to working on this project, and in my brief time back working, I&rsquo;ve pivoted from working on the frontend to working on the backend. My last few commits have been to essentially rip one of the examples from the yew framework into some sort of working frontend mock-up, but I got pretty burnt out and frustrated. I was essentially copy-pasting, and not really doing any learning or understanding. Additionally, it became apparent that having a mock-up of the frontend wouldn&rsquo;t really work well if I had no content to have it dynamically display, so I decided to go back to figuring out server-side stuff.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been doing my best recently to learn how daemons work, and while some initial cursory google searches (and overcomplicated networking class from last semester) had me worried about the complexity of implementing a daemon in rust, further research showed that systemd will solve all my problems (&hellip;surely?).</p>

<p>From here on out I&rsquo;ll be working on implementing a basic socket listening application in Rust, with the future goal of having it listen for connections and accept incoming data (blog posts). I also want it to be easily configurable with some sort of central config file that it reads from, but I&rsquo;ll start with a basic default config.</p>

<p>One major concern going forward is security&ndash;if I just make the daemon listen through a tcp socket with the eventual goal of downloading files onto the server, there are clear possibilities for RCE and other major vulnerabilities if I&rsquo;m not careful. As of right now, my strategy to avoid this is to use some sort of SSH authentication. Doing a quick look at a popular ssh package in Rust, it doesn&rsquo;t seem like it&rsquo;ll be too hard to do.</p>

<p>Idea:</p>

<ul>
<li>simple http file transfer by default</li>
<li>the server can have a certificate file configured such as to allow https file transfer</li>
<li>the idea is that the use case for this project is to be &lsquo;plugged-in&rsquo; to an already existing website. If the website already has a certificate for HTTPS then it can be used by this software for secure https transfer.

</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>Later Edit:
So after some thought it really seems like HTTPS/relying on the target server having an SSL certificate is the best idea. And using SSH as an underlying encryption method is still viable, but the main security problem isn&rsquo;t encrypted data transfer, but rather the ability for a malicious actor to connect to the server and upload files without any verification.</p>

<p>I think for the time being, since my research into encryption and best practices has brought progress to a grinding halt, what I will instead do is focus on making a non-secure MVP which just uses simple, unprotected/unauthenticated TCP sockets to transfer the files. Once that is done, I can extend it with security options like using a password, asymmetric encryption, etc. (check ssh known_hosts, or keep track of its own registered hosts?)</p>
